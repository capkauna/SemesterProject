            <h2>Past</h2>
            <p>We started as a humble petshop aiming to unite people with their future best friend companions, named simply 'Pets'. </p>
            <p>During the pandemic, it became increasingly clear that people and pets needed out help even more to find each other
                 and we spared no effort to bring them together.</p>
            <p>When the danger was past, our clients and their new friends needed help with overcoming the new challenge
                of separation during work and holiday times.</p>
            </p>
            <p>And VIAPets was created, no longer just a petshop, but also a kennel, providing much needed care and attention for our clients' furry or feathered friends.</p>
